Lions live in this zoo, and when they are locked in cage, they cannot be placed horizontally or vertically
Zoo's trainer is troubled by placement of lions
Find out how many cases we have of placing lions in a 2*N array
It is assumed that the number of cases in which none of the lions are placed is the number of cases

```txt
Input: 4
Output: 41
```

## Solution

```py
n = int(input())
dp = [[0, 0, 0] for _ in range(n + 1)]
dp[1][0] = dp[1][1] = dp[1][2] = 1
for i in range(2, n + 1):
  dp[i][0] = (dp[i - 1][0] + dp[i - 1][1] + dp[i - 1][2]) % 9901
  dp[i][1] = (dp[i - 1][0] + dp[i - 1][2]) % 9901
  dp[i][2] = (dp[i - 1][0] + dp[i - 1][1]) % 9901

print(sum(dp[n]) % 9901)
```
