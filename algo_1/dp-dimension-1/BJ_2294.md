There are n kinds of coins. use these coins in moderation so that the sum of the coins is k won
In doing so, we try to minimize the number of coins

```txt
Input:
3 15
1
5
12

Output: 3
```

## Solution

* py

```py
n, k = map(int, input().split())

memo = [0] + [10001] * k
for _ in range(n):
  coin = int(input())
  for i in range(coin, k + 1):
    memo[i] = min(memo[i], memo[i - coin] + 1)
print(memo[k] if memo[k] != 10001 else -1)
```
