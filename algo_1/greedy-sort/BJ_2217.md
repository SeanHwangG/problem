If multiple ropes are connected in parallel, the weight of each rope can be divided
When object in which weight is w is lifted by using rope of k, weight as much as w / k hangs on each rope
With threhold of each ropes, print max weight of an object that can be lifted (do not have to use all the ropes)

```txt
Input:

```

## Solution

* py

  ```py
  N = int(input())
  li = list(sorted([int(input()) for _ in range(N)], reverse=True))
  ret = 0
  for i, n in enumerate(li):
    ret = max(ret, (i + 1) * n)
  print(ret)
  ```
