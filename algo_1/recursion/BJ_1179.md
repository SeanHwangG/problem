  ```en
  N people from No. 1 to No. N sit in a circle, and a positive integer K is given
  Now remove the K-th person in order
  When one person is removed, the process continues along the circle of the remaining people
  This process continues until all N people are removed
  ```

* tc

  ```tc
  Input: 7 3
  Output: <3, 6, 2, 7, 5, 1, 4>
  ```

## Solution

* py

  ```py
  import sys
  def solve(N,M):
    if M == 1: return N - 1
    if N == 1: return 0
    if 1 < N <= M:
      return (solve(N - 1, M) + M) % N
    NN = N - N // M
    tmp = (solve(NN, M) - N%M) % NN
    return M * tmp // (M-1)
  sys.setrecursionlimit(0x100000)
  N,M = map(int, input().split())
  print(solve(N, M) + 1)
  ```
