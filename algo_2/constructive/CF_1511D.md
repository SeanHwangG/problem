# [CF_1511D](https://codeforces.com/contest/1511/D)

Define cost of a string 𝑠 as number of index pairs i and j $$ (1 ≤ i < j < |s| ) $$
Such that $$ s_i == s_j $$ and $$ s_i + 1 = s_j + 1 $$
Given two positive integers 𝑛 and 𝑘
Among strings with length 𝑛 that contain only first 𝑘 characters of alphabet, find string with min possible cost

Input: 9 4
Output: aabacadbb
```

## Solution

* py

```py
n, k = map(int, input().split())
z = ""
for i in range(k):
  c = chr(ord('a') + i)
  z += c
  for j in range(i + 1, k):
    z += c + chr(ord('a') + j)
while len(z) < n:
  z += z
print(z[:n])
```
