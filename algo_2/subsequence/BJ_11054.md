  S1 < S2 < ... based on which number of Sk is sequence S Sk-1 < Sk > Sk+1 > ... If SN-1 > SN, sequence is called bitonic
  Find longest bitonic
  ```

* tc

  ```tc
  Input:
  10
  1 5 2 1 4 3 4 5 2 1

  Output: 7
  ```

## Solution

* py

  ```py
  N = int(input())
  li = list(map(int, input().split()))
  increase = [1 for _ in range(N)]
  decrease = [1 for _ in range(N)]
  mx_bitonic = 1
  for i in range(N):
    for j in range(i):
      if li[i] > li[j]:
        increase[i] = max(increase[i], increase[j] + 1)

  for i in range(N-1, -1, -1):
    for j in range(i + 1, N):
      if li[i] > li[j]:
        decrease[i] = max(decrease[i], decrease[j] + 1)
      mx_bitonic = max(mx_bitonic, decrease[i] + increase[i] - 1)

  print(mx_bitonic)
  ```
