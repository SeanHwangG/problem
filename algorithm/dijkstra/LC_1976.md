* City consists of n intersections numbered from 0 to n - 1 with bi-directional roads between some intersections
* You can reach any intersection from any other intersection and that there is at most one road between any two intersections
* Given n and 2D array roads where roads[i] = [ui, vi, timei] is a road between ui and vi that takes timei minutes to travel
* You want to know in how many ways you can travel from intersection 0 to intersection n - 1 in the shortest amount of time
* Return number of ways modulo 10^9 + 7 you can arrive at your destination in the shortest amount of time

Input: n = 7, roads = [[0,6,7],[0,1,2],[1,2,3],[1,3,3],[6,3,3],[3,5,1],[6,5,1],[2,5,1],[0,4,5],[4,6,2]]
Output: 4

Input: n = 2, roads = [[1,0,10]]
Output: 1
