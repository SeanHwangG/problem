* In a project, you have a list of required skills req_skills, and a list of people
* The ith person people[i] contains a list of skills that the person has
* Sufficient team: a set of people such that for every required skill in req_skills, there should be a person with that skill
  * We can represent these teams by the index of each person
* Return any sufficient team of the smallest possible size, represented by the index of each person in any order
