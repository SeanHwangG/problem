* Given an integer n, which indicates that there are n courses labeled from 1 to n
* Given an array relations where relations[i] = [prev, next]
  * representing prerequisite relation between course prev and next: course prev has to be taken before course next
* Also, you are given the integer k.
* In one semester, take at most k courses if you have taken all prerequisites in previous semester for courses you are taking
* Return min number of semesters needed to take all courses, it is always possible to take every course.
