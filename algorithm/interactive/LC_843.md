* Given unique strings wordlist where wordlist[i] is 6 letters long, and one word in this list is chosen as secret
* call Master.guess(word) to guess a word. guessed word must be from original list with 6 lowercase letters
* This function returns an integer type, representing # exact matches (value and position) of guess to secret word
* Also, if guess is not in given wordlist, it will return -1 instead
* For each test case, have exactly 10 chances to guess word

```txt
Input: secret = "acckzz", wordlist = ["acckzz","ccbazz","eiowzz","abcczz"]
Output: Success
master.guess("aaaaaa") returns -1, because "aaaaaa" is not in wordlist.
master.guess("acckzz") returns 6, because "acckzz" is secret and has all 6 matches.  # Success
master.guess("ccbazz") returns 3, because "ccbazz" has 3 matches.
master.guess("eiowzz") returns 2, because "eiowzz" has 2 matches.
master.guess("abcczz") returns 4, because "abcczz" has 4 matches.
