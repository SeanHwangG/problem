* Game on an undirected graph is played by two players, Mouse and Cat, who alternate turns
* Graph is given as follows: graph[a] is a list of all nodes b such that ab is an edge of graph
* Mouse starts at node 1 and goes first, the cat starts at node 2 and goes second, and hole is at node 0
* During each player's turn, they must travel along one edge of the graph that meets where they are
* For example, if the Mouse is at node 1, it must travel to any node in graph[1]
* Then, the game can end in three ways:
  * If ever the Cat occupies the same node as the Mouse, the Cat wins
  * If ever the Mouse reaches the Hole, Mouse wins (cat cannot travel to Hole)
  * If ever position is repeated ([ex] players in same position as previous, and it is same player's turn to move), draw
* Given a graph, and assuming both players play optimally, return 1 if the mouse wins, 2 if the cat wins, or 0 if a draw

```txt
Input: graph = [[2,5],[3],[0,4,5],[1,4,5],[2,3],[0,2,3]]
Output: 0

Input: graph = [[1,3],[0],[3],[0,2]]
Output: 1
```

> Hint

* Color each node marked DRAW, If any child is colored MOUSE, then this node will also be MOUSE
