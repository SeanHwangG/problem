* Special binary strings are binary strings with the following two properties:
* The number of 0's is equal to the number of 1's
* Every prefix of the binary string has at least as many 1's as 0's
* You are given a special binary string s
* A move consists of choosing two consecutive, non-empty, special substrings of s, and swapping them
* Two strings are consecutive if last character of first string is exactly one index before first character of second string
* Return the lexicographically largest resulting string possible after applying the mentioned operations on the string

```txt
Input: s = "11011000"
Output: "11100100"  # The strings "10" [occuring at s[1]] and "1100" [at s[3]] are swapped.
```
