# [LC_minimize-malware-spread-ii](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimize-malware-spread-ii)

Given adjacency matrix, and initial infected nodes in a list
Print node when removed can save maximum amount of nodes, remove smallest if there are multiple

```txt
Input: graph = [[1,1,0],[1,1,0],[0,0,1]], initial = [0,1]
Output: 0
```

## Solution

* Define node a is infected by node b if node a will be infected by node b without through any other infected node

```py
def minMalwareSpread(self, graph: List[List[int]], initial: List[int]) -> int:
  clean = set(range(len(graph))) - set(initial)
  def dfs(i):
    seen.add(i)
    [dfs(j) for j, v in enumerate(graph[i]) if v and j in clean and j not in seen]

  inffect = defaultdict(list)
  for i in initial:
    seen = set()
    dfs(i)
    for j in seen - {i}:
      inffect[j] += i,

  unique = Counter(v[0] for k, v in inffect.items() if len(v) == 1)
  return unique and min(unique, key=lambda x:(-unique[x], x)) or min(initial)
```
