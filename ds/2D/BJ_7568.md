* en

  ```en
  For person A and B, A.weight > B.weight and A.height > B.height, we say that A is "greater" than B
  For each person, print 1 + number of people who are greater than oneself
  ```

* tc

  ```tc
  Input: 5
  55 185   # Smaller than 3rd
  58 183   # Smaller than 3rd
  88 186
  60 175   # Smaller than 3th
  46 155   # Smaller than 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th

  Output: 2 2 1 2 5  # Print rank based on score
  ```

## Solution

* cpp

  ```cpp
  #include <iostream>
  int main()
  {
    int N, c;
    std::cin >> N;
    int a[N][2];
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
    {
      std::cin >> a[i][0] >> a[i][1];
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
    {
      c = 0;
      for (int j = 0; j < N; j++)
      {
        if (i != j && a[i][0] < a[j][0] && a[i][1] < a[j][1])
          c++;
      }
      std::cout << c + 1 << " ";
    }
  }
  ```

* py

  ```py
  t=[(*map(int, input().split()),) for k in range(int(input()))]
  print(*(sum(x < p and y < q for p, q in t) + 1 for x, y in t))
  ```
