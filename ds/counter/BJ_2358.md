  ```

## Solution

* py

  ```py
  from collections import Counter
  N = int(input())
  x_cnt = Counter()
  y_cnt = Counter()
  for _ in range(N):
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    x_cnt[x] += 1
    y_cnt[y] += 1

  ret = 0
  for x in x_cnt:
    if x_cnt[x] > 1:
      ret += 1
  for y in y_cnt:
    if y_cnt[y] > 1:
      ret += 1
  print(ret)
  ```
