## Solution

* py

  ```py
  from collections import Counter
  N = int(input())
  G = []
  c1, c2, c3 = Counter(), Counter(), Counter()
  for _ in range(N):
    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
    c1[a] += 1
    c2[b] += 1
    c3[c] += 1
    G.append([a, b, c])
  for a, b, c in G:
    print((a if c1[a] == 1 else 0) + (b if c2[b] == 1 else 0) + (c if c3[c] == 1 else 0))
  ```
