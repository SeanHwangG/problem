  for _ in range(int(input())):
    N, M = map(int, input().split())
    weight = deque(map(int, input().split()))
    index = deque(range(N))

    res = 1
    while True:
      if index[0] == M and weight[0] == max(weight):
        break
      else:
        if weight[0] == max(weight):
          weight.popleft()
          index.popleft()
          res += 1
        else:
          weight.append(weight.popleft())
          index.append(index.popleft())
    print(res)
  ```
