  When given N cards with (1, 2, ..., N), which card would be left to the end at the end of following simulations.
  Until there is one card
    - Throw top card on floor
    - Move the top card to bottom of card

  ```tc
  Input: 6
  Output: 4 (123456 -> 34562 -> 5624 -> 246 -> 64 -> 4)
  ```

## Solution

* cpp

  ```cpp
  #include<iostream>
  #include<queue>
  using namespace std;

  int N;
  queue<int> q;

  int main() {
    cin >> N;
    for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) q.push(i);
    while (q.size() != 1) {
      q.pop();
      q.push(q.front());
      q.pop();
    }
    cout << q.front();
  }
  ```

* py

  ```py
  from collections import deque
  deck = deque(range(1, int(input()) + 1))
  while len(deck) > 1:
    deck.popleft()
    deck.append(deck.popleft())
  print(deck[0])
  ```
