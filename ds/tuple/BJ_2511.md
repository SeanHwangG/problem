  b_scores = list(map(int,input().split()))
  a_point = b_point = 0
  last = 'D'
  for a_score, b_score in zip(a_scores, b_scores):
    if a_score > b_score:
      last = 'A'
      a_point += 3
    elif a_score < b_score:
      last = 'B'
      b_point += 3
    else:
      a_point += 1
      b_point += 1
  print(a_point, b_point)
  if a_point > b_point:
    print("A")
  elif b_point < a_point:
    print("B")
