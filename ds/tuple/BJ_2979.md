# [BJ_2979](https://acmicpc.net/problem/2979)

Parking lot offers a discount on parking fees depending on the number of trucks parked
For a truck, A won per minute. Pay B won per minute for two cars and C won per minute for three cars
When A, B, and C are given, and full-time trucks are given parking time, find how much they should pay for parking

```txt
Input:
5 3 1
1 6
3 5
2 8

Output: 33
```

## Solution

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int in, out, ans = 0;
  int cars[110] = {0, };
  int cost[110] = {0, };
  for (int i = 1; i <= 3; i++) cin >> cost[i];
  for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    cin >> in >> out;
    for (int time = in; time < out; time++)
      cars[time]++;
  }
  for(int t = 1; t < 101; t++)
    ans += cars[t] * cost[cars[t]];
  cou << ans;
  return 0;
}
```

```py
costs = list(map(int, input().split()))
li = []
for _ in range(3):
  e, l = map(int, input().split())
  li.extend([(e, 'e'), (l, 'l')])

ret, cur, last = 0, 0, 0
for time, typ in sorted(li):
  if typ == 'e':
    ret += (time - last) * costs[cur - 1] * cur
    cur += 1
  else:
    ret += (time - last) * costs[cur - 1] * cur
    cur -= 1
  last = time

print(ret)
```
