Given A, B, C, D, E
When meat is frozen and temperature is < 0: temperature rises 1 in C second
When meat is frozen and temperature is == 0: it takes D seconds to make it unfrozen (thawing)
When meat is not frozen: temperature rises by 1 in E second
Find how many seconds it takes for meat from A to warm to B

```

## Solution

```py
a, b, c, d, e = int(input()), int(input()), int(input()), int(input()), int(input())
print(e * (b - a) if a > 0 else (-a * c) + d + e * b)
```
