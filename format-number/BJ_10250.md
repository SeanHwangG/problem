Customers don't care about the distance they travel by elevator
However, when the walking distance is the same, the room downstairs is preferred
The contents print the room number to be assigned to the Nth guest

```txt
Input:
2
6 12 10
30 50 72

Output:
402
1203
```

## Solution

```py
for _ in range(int(input())):
  h, w, n = map(int, input().split())
  print(f'{(n - 1) % h + 1}{(n - 1) // h + 1:02}')
```
