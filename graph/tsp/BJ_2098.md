  ```en
  Cost of moving between each city is given in the form of matrix W[i][j]
  W[i][j] represents the cost of going from city i to city j. Cost is not symmetrical
  In some cases, you can not go from city i to city j, W[i][j]=0
  ```

* tc

  ```tc
  Input: 4
  0 10 15 20
  5 0 9 10
  6 13 0 12
  8 8 9 0

  Output: 35
  ```

## Solution

* py

  ```py
  N, G = int(input()), []
  INF = float('inf')
  for _ in range(N):
    G.append(list(map(int,input().split())))

  def find_path(last, visited, dp):
    if visited == (1<<N) - 1:
      return G[last][0] or INF

    if dp[last][visited] is not None:
      return dp[last][visited]

    tmp=INF
    for city in range(N):
      if visited & (1 << city) == 0 and G[last][city] != 0:
        tmp=min(tmp, find_path(city, visited | (1<<city), dp) + G[last][city])
    dp[last][visited]=tmp
    return tmp
  dp = [[None]*(1<<N) for _ in range(N)]  # dp[a][b] = current node a, visited nodes bit

  print(find_path(0, 1, dp))
  ```
