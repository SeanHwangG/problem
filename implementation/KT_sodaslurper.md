Only way to obtain more soda is to take the money he gets when he recycles empty soda bottles to buy new ones.
In addition to the empty bottles resulting from his own consumption he sometimes nd empty bottles in the street. 
One day he was extra thirsty, so he actually drank sodas until he couldn't afford a new one.

3 non-negative int e, f, c, where e < 1000 equals # empty soda bottles in at start of day, f < 1000 # of empty soda bottles found during day
1 < c < 2000 # empty bottles required to buy a new soda.
How many sodas did Tim drink on his extra thirsty day?
