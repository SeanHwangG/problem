Data as transmitted takes form of 16-bit integer values. However, due there is some risk of data corruption.
To help detect such corruption, for each 16-bit value that is transmitted, an additional single bit is sent.
Additional single bit is 1 if the corresponding 16-bit integer has an ODD number of 1s when represented in binary
Check bit is a 0 if the corresponding 16-bit integer has an EVEN # 1s when represented in binary. Effect is that: # bits set to 1 in combined 17 bits is always EVEN

First line contains # test cases (< 100). Each line one test case: the first number is 16-bit int, and following number is check bit

For each test case, you are to output “Corrupt” if the check bit doesn’t match up with the even or oddness of the integer, or “Valid” if it does.

```

```kr
a, b 가 주이전다
a를 이진수로 바꿨을때 1의 개수를 2로 나눈게 b 라면 "Valid" 아니면 "Corrupt"를 출력하라
```

```txt
Input: 4
34173 1
45 1
15 0
31 0

Output: Valid
Corrupt # 0000000000101101  even 1, check bit should be 0
Valid
Corrupt
```

## Solution

* py

  ```py
  for _ in range(int(input())):
    a, b = input().split()
    print("Valid" if bin(int(a))[2:].count("1") % 2 == int(b) else "Corrupt")
  ```
