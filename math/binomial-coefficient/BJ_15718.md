Output: 2  # 1, 2, 0 / 2, 1, 0
```

## Solution

* py

  ```py
  import sys
  import math

  def lucas(n, m, p):
    ret = 1
    while n or m:
      ni, mi = n % p, m % p
      ret *= math.comb(ni, mi)
      ret %= p
      n, m = n // p, m // p
    return ret

  t = int(sys.stdin.readline())
  for _ in range(t):
    n, m = (int(x) for x in sys.stdin.readline().split())
    if n == 0 and m == 1:
      print(1)
      continue
    elif n == 0 or m == 1:
      print(0)
      continue
    a1, a2 = lucas(n - 1, m - 2, 97), lucas(n - 1, m - 2, 1031)
    print((a1 * 35 * 1031 + a2 * 659 * 97) % (97 * 1031))
  ```
