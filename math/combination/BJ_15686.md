```en
Chicken streets are streets between house and nearest chicken house: chicken streets are set based on house
  Each house has chicken streets
City's chicken distance is the sum of all the home's chicken streets
Find M chicken house that minimizes citie's chicken distance
```

Input:
5 3
0 0 1 0 0
0 0 2 0 1
0 1 2 0 0
0 0 1 0 0
0 0 0 0 2

Output: 5
```

## Solution

* py

  ```py
  from itertools import combinations

  N, M = map(int, input().split())
  G = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(N)]

  houses = []
  chickens = []
  for i in range(N):
    for j in range(N):
      if G[i][j] == 1:   houses.append((i, j))
      elif G[i][j] == 2: chickens.append((i, j))

  minv = float('inf')
  for ch in combinations(chickens, M):
    sumv = 0
    for house in houses:
      sumv += min([abs(house[0]-i[0])+abs(house[1]-i[1]) for i in ch])
      if minv <= sumv:
        break
    minv = min(minv, sumv)

  print(minv)
  ```
