  int c = 1;
  char s[6];
  int main() {
    scanf("%s", s + 1);
    for (int i = 1; s[i]; i++) c *= (s[i] == 'c' ? 26 : 10) - (s[i] == s[i - 1]);
    printf("%d", c);
  }
  ```

* py

  ```py
  s = input()
  ret = 1
  for i, ch in enumerate(s):
    if ch == 'd':
      if i != 0 and s[i - 1] == 'd':
        ret *= 9
      else:
        ret *= 10
    else:
      if i != 0 and s[i - 1] == 'c':
        ret *= 25
      else:
        ret *= 26
  print(ret)
  ```
