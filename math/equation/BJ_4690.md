Print all triple that satisfies a^3 = b^3 + c^3 + d^3 under a <= 100

```txt
Output:
Cube = 6, Triple = (3,4,5)
Cube = 12, Triple = (6,8,10)
Cube = 18, Triple = (2,12,16)
Cube = 18, Triple = (9,12,15)
Cube = 19, Triple = (3,10,18)
Cube = 20, Triple = (7,14,17)
Cube = 24, Triple = (12,16,20)
```

## Solution

* py

  ```py
  for a in range(101):
  for b in range(2,a):
  for c in range(b,a):
  for d in range(c,a):
      if a**3==b**3+c**3+d**3:print(f"Cube = {a}, Triple = ({b},{c},{d})")
  ```
