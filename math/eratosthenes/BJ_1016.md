Special number is when number X does not fall apart by dividing it by a square number greater than one
Given min and max, print out how many special numbers exist between min and max

```txt
Input: 1 10
Output: 7
```

## Solution

* py

  ```py
  mn, mx = map(int, input().split())
  li = [1] * (mx - mn + 1)
  for root in range(2, int(mx ** 0.5) + 1):
    square = root ** 2
    for n in range(max(mn // square, 1), mx // square + 1):
      if mn <= square * n <= mx:
        li[square * n - mn] = 0

  print(sum(li))
  ```
