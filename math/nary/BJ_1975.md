Define f(N, b) as the last number of consecutive zeros to follow when N is represented in binary b

∑_{b=2}^∞ f(N, b)

```txt
Input: 2
5
10

Output: 1
3
```

## Solution

```py
from sys import stdin
def func(n):
  r = 0
  for b in range(2,n+1):
    t = n
    while t % b == 0:
      r += 1
      t //= b
  return r
input()
A = list(map(func, range(1001)))
for s in stdin:
  print(A[int(s)])
```
