String is beautiful if it does not contain a substring of length at least 2, which is a palindrome
Let's define cost of a string as the minimum number of operations so that the string becomes beautiful
If in one operation it is allowed to change any character of the string to one of the "abc".
Given a string 𝑠 of length 𝑛, each character of the string is in "abc".
For 𝑚 queries — calculate the cost of the substring of the string 𝑠 from 𝑙𝑖-th to 𝑟𝑖-th position, inclusive.

```txt
Input:
5 4
baacb
1 3
1 5
4 5
2 3

Output:
1  # bac
2  # cbacb
0
1
```

## Solution

* py

  ```py
  import itertools

  n, m = map(int, input().split())
  s = input()
  periods = list(itertools.permutations('abc'))
  c = {p: [0] for p in periods}
  for i, ch in enumerate(s):
    for p in periods:
      c[p].append(c[p][-1] + (ch != p[i % 3]))
  for _ in range(m):
    l, r = map(int, input().split())
    print(min(c[p][r] - c[p][l - 1] for p in periods))
  ```
