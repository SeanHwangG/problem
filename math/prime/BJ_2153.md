a to one, b to two, â€¦, z to 26, A to 27, Z as 52
For example, cyworld is 100 when the sum is obtained, and abcd is 10
Check if a word is prime (assume 1 is prime)

```txt
Input: UFRN
Output: It is a prime word.
```

## Solution

* py

  ```py
  t = input()
  n = 0
  for i in t:
    if ord(i)>96:
      n += ord(i)-96
    else:
      n += ord(i)-38  #64-26
  for i in range(2,n):
    if n % i == 0:
      print('It is not a prime word.')
      break
  else:
    print('It is a prime word.')
  ```
