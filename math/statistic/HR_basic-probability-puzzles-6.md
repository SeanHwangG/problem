X contains 5 white balls and 4 black balls, Y contains 7 white balls and 6 black balls
draw 1 ball from bag X and, without observing its color, put it into bag Y
Now, if a ball is drawn from bag Y, find the probability that it is black

```txt
Output: 29/63
```

## Solution

* py

  ```py
  bag_x = ['w', 'w', 'w', 'w', 'w', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'b']
  bag_y = ['w', 'w', 'w', 'w', 'w', 'w', 'w', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'b']

  total, count = 0, 0
  while len(bag_x) != 0:
    ball = bag_x.pop()
    bag_y.append(ball)
    total += len(bag_y)
    count += bag_y.count('b')
    bag_y.pop()

  print(f"{counter}/{total}")
  ```
