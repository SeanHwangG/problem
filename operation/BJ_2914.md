The impact factor of a scientific journal is a measure reflecting the average number of citations to articles published in scientific journals.
For this task we are using a simplified formula for calculating the impact factor:

(Total sum of all citations articles published in the journal received)/(Total number of articles published)

Rounding is always performed up.
For example, the impact factor of the “Journal for ore research and time-wasting” that published 38 articles quoted 894 times is 894 / 38 = 23.53 rounding up to 24.

You are the editor of one scientific journal.
You know how many articles you are going to publish and the owners are pushing you to reach a specific impact factor.
You are wondering how many scientists you will have to bribe to cite your article to meet the owner's demands.
Since money is tight you want to bribe the minimal amount of scientists.
