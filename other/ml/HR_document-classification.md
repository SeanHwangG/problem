  transformer = HashingVectorizer(stop_words='english')

  trains, labels = [], []
  with open('trainingdata.txt') as f:
    for i in range(int(f.readline())):
      s = f.readline().rstrip()
      idx = s.find(' ')
      trains.append(s[idx+1:])
      labels.append(int(s[:idx]))
  train = transformer.fit_transform(trains)
