* en

  ```en
  Sorted N scores on the list are given, and new scores are given
  At this time, find out what the new score ranks on the ranking list
  If the score is too low to be on the ranking list, print -1
  ```

* tc

  ```tc
  Input: 3 90 10
  100 90 80

  Output: 2  # New ranking would be 100 90 90 and it's 2nd

  Input: 10 1 10
  10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1

  Output: -1  # New score cannot go into rank

  Input: 0 0 50
  Output: 1
  ```

## Solution

* py

  ```py
  N, score, p = map(int, input().split())
  if N == 0:
    print(1)
    exit()
  li = list(map(int, input().split()))
  if len(li) >= p and li[p - 1] >= score:
    print(-1)
  else:
    li += [-1]
    for i in range(p):
      if li[i] <= score:
        print(i + 1)
        break
  ```
