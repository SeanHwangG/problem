  ```en
  Number of current score (0 <= N), new score, maximum players (10 <= P) in score board are given in first line (N <= P)
  Then in second line Sorted N scores on the list are given, and new scores are given
  At this time, find out what the new score ranks on the ranking list
  If the score is too low to be on the ranking list, print -1
  ```

* tc

  ```tc
  Input: 3 90 10  # number of current scores, your score, number of max_score
  100 90 80

  Output: 2  # New ranking would be 1:100 2:90 2:90 4: and your 2nd

  Input: 10 1 10
  10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1

  Output: -1  # New score cannot go into rank

  Input: 0 0 50
  Output: 1
  ```

## Solution

* cpp

  ```cpp
  #include <iostream>
  using namespace std;
  int main() {
    int n, m, p, a = 1, b = 1, score;
    cin >> n >> score >> m;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      int c;
      cin >> c;
      if (c > score) a++;
      if (c >= score) b++;
    }
    if (b > m)
      cout << "-1";
    else
      cout << a;
  }
  ```

* py

  ```py
  N, score, p = map(int, input().split())
  if N == 0:
    print(1)
    exit()
  li = list(map(int, input().split()))
  if len(li) >= p and li[p - 1] >= score:
    print(-1)
  else:
    li += [-1]
    for i in range(p):
      if li[i] <= score:
        print(i + 1)
        break
  ```
