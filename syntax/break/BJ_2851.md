There are 10 mushrooms. A certain amount of points is awarded for picking each of the mushrooms
Must pick mushrooms in order they appear, but is not required to pick them all â€“ 
his goal is to score a number of points as close as possible to 100. 

In case there exist two such numbers which are equally close to 100 (e.g. 98 and 102), Mario will pick the greater one (in this case 102). 

Input consists of 10 lines, each of which contains one positive integer less than or equal to 100, denoting the scores awarded for picking each mushroom, in the order that Mario can pick them in.
