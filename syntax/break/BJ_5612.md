# vehicles passing in 1 minute at entrance and exit of Namsan Tunnel 1 was investigated
# cars passing through entrance and # cars passing through exit in one minute from (i-1) minutes have passed
At this time, find out how many vehicles there were when there were the most vehicles in tunnel

```txt
Input: 3  # N
2     # Initial cars
2 3  # Entered, Exit
2 3
4 1

Output: 3

Input: 3

2 3
2 4
4 1

Output: 0
```

## Solution

* go

```go
package main

import (
  "bufio"
  "fmt"
  "os"
)

var min = 0
var inCars = 0
var res = 0

func main() {
  stdin := bufio.NewReader(os.Stdin)
  fmt.Fscanf(stdin, "%d\n", &min)
  fmt.Fscanf(stdin, "%d\n", &inCars)
  for i := 0; i < min; i++ {
    inCar := 0
    outCar := 0
    fmt.Fscanf(stdin, "%d %d\n", &inCar, &outCar)
    inCars += inCar
    inCars -= outCar
    if inCars < 0 {
      res = 0
      break
    }
    if res < inCars {
      res = inCars
    }
  }

  fmt.Println(res)
}
```

* py

```py
n = int(input())
m = res = int(input())
for _ in range(n):
  a,b = map(int, input().split())
  m += a - b
  res = max(m,res)
  if m < 0:
    print(0)
    break
else:
  print(res)
```
