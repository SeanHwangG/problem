* en

  ```en
  In each line a, b are given and input ends with 0 0
  Print minimum integer c, so that median and average of (a, b, c) are the same
  ```

* tc

  ```tc
  Input: 1 2
  6 10
  1 1000000000
  0 0
  Output:
  0  # Median and mean of (1, 2, 0) are both 1
  2  # Median and mean of (6, 10, 2) are both 6
  -999999998
  ```

## Solution

* py

  ```py
  while True:
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    if a == 0 and b == 0: break
    print(min(a, b) - abs(a - b))
  ```
