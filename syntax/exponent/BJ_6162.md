```en
For N test, if expected rain is more than actual rain, but not by factor of more than 5,  “drought”
If expected rain is more by factor of strictly more than 5, but not by factor of more than 25,  “mega drought”
If it is more by a factor of strictly more than 25, but not by a factor more than 125, “mega mega drought”
(ex: For each factor of 5, you add another “mega”)

If its smaller than 5 print no drought



```

```txt
Input: 3     # N
100 100    # a, b
12375 99
10 2

Output: Data Set 1:
no drought

Data Set 2:
mega mega drought  # 12375 / 99 = 125

Data Set 3:
drought
```

## Solution

* py

  ```py
  from math import log

  for i in range(int(input())):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    print(f"Data Set {i + 1}:")
    if a // b >= 5:
      print("mega " * int(log((a - 1) / b, 5)) + "drought")
    else:
      print("no drought")
    print()
  ```
