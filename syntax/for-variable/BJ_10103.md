Antonia and David are playing a game. Each player starts with 100 points.

Game uses 6 dice and is played in rounds. During round, each player rolls one die. 
Player with the lower roll loses the number of points shown on the higher die.
If both players roll the same number, no points are lost by either player.

Print the number of points that David has after all rounds have been played.

```txt
Input: 4  # N
5 6
6 6
4 3
5 2

Output:
94  # 100 - 6
91  # 100 - 4 - 5
```

## Solution

* py

  ```py
  c = s = 100
  for _ in range(int(input())):
    first, second = map(int, input().split())
    if first < second:
      c -= second
    elif first > second:
      s -= first
  print(c, s, sep='\n')
  ```
