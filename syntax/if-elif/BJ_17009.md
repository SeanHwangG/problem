# [BJ_17009](https://acmicpc.net/problem/17009)

Points are scored by a 3-point shot, a 2-point field goal, or a 1-point free throw.
Given the number of each of these types of scoring for the two teams: the Apples and the Bananas
first three lines of input describe the scoring of the Apples, and the next three lines of input describe the scoring of the Bananas
If Apples scored more than Banana, output 'A'. If Banana scored more points than Apple, output 'B'. Otherwise, output 'T', to indicate tie


```txt
Input: 10
3
7
8
9
6
Output: B
```

## Solution

```py
apple = banana = 0
apple += int(input()) * 3
apple += int(input()) * 2
apple += int(input())
banana += int(input()) * 3
banana += int(input()) * 2
banana += int(input())
if apple < banana:
  print('B')
elif apple == banana:
  print('T')
else:
  print('A')
```
