# [BJ_6763](https://acmicpc.net/problem/6763)

If the driver is not speeding, the output should be:
  1 to 20: $100
  21 to 30: $270
  31 or above: $500
  Congratulations, you are within the speed limit!
If the driver is speeding, the output should be:
  You are speeding and your fine is $F

```txt
Input: 100  # Speed Limit
131            # Driver's Speed

Output: You are speeding and your fine is $500.
```

## Solution

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
  var a, b int
  fmt.Scan(&a, &b)
  c := b - a
  switch {
  case c <= 0:
    fmt.Print("Congratulations, you are within the speed limit!")
  case c <= 20:
    fmt.Print("You are speeding and your fine is $100.")
  case c <= 30:
    fmt.Print("You are speeding and your fine is $270.")
  default:
    fmt.Print("You are speeding and your fine is $500.")
  }
}
```

```py
a = int(input())
b = int(input())
if b - a <= 0:
  print("Congratulations, you are within the speed limit!")
elif b - a <= 20:
  print("You are speeding and your fine is $100.")
elif b - a <= 30:
  print("You are speeding and your fine is $270.")
else:
  print("You are speeding and your fine is $500.")
```
