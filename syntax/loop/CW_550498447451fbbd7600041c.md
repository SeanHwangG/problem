  ```en
  Given arrays a, b, checks if they have same elements, multiplicities
  multiplicity of member is # times it appears
  Same means, here, that the elements in b are the elements in a squared, regardless of the order
  ```

* tc

  ```tc
  Input: a = [19, 19, 19, 11], b = [121, 361, 361, 361]
  Output: True

  Input: a = [1, 3, 3], b = [1, 1, 9]
  Output: False  # They are same but multiplicity is different
  ```

## Solution

* r

  ```r
  comp <- function(a, b) {
    all(sort(a * a) == sort(b))
  }
  ```
