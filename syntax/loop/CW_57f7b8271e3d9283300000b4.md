  If the sum of even numbers is greater than the odd numbers return: "Even is greater than Odd"
  If the sum of odd numbers is greater than the sum of even numbers return: "Odd is greater than Even"
  If the total of both even and odd numbers are identical return: "Even and Odd are the same"

  ```

## Solution

* r

  ```r
  even_or_odd <- function(s){
    nos <- as.numeric(strsplit(s, "")[[1]])
    evens <- nos[nos %% 2 == 0]
    odds <- nos[!(nos %% 2 == 0)]
    if (sum(evens) > sum(odds)) return("Even is greater than Odd")
    else if (sum(odds) > sum(evens)) return("Odd is greater than Even")
    else return("Even and Odd are the same")
  }
  ```
