  ```en
  Write O or X on the back of the card, when trying to write down K and X (N-K)
  Print maximum # cards with the same shape on the front and back sides
  ```

* tc

  ```tc
  Input: 4 3 2  # O
  Output: 3
  ```

## Solution

* Let's define card as (Front, back)
* Maximum number of (O, O) is min(M, K)
* Minimum number of (X, X) is min(N - M, N - K)

* py

  ```py
  N, M, K = map(int, input().split())
  print(min(M, K) + min(N - M, N - K))
  ```
