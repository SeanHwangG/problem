The bike rental allows you to choose one of two monthly options:

Monthly fee is a. Every day, first 30 minutes are free, and every minute above that costs x
Monthly fee is b. Every day, first 45 minutes are free, and every minute above that costs y
There are 21 working days in November, and you spend T minutes commuting every day
Calculate how many roubles you would spend if you use either one of two monthly options

Output 2 integers - amount of money you would spend on first option and second option, respectively.

```txt
Input: 10  # a
1    # x
20  # b
5    # y

## Solution

* py

  ```py
  a, x, b, y, t = int(input()), int(input()), int(input()), int(input()), int(input())
  print(a + 21 * x * max(0, t - 30), b + 21 * y * max(0, t - 45))
  ```
