  Three kangaroos are playing on a number line, each occupying a different integer.
  In a single move, one of the outer kangaroos jumps into the space between the other two.
  At no point may two kangaroos occupy the same position.

  Three integers A, B and C (0 < A < B < C < 100), the initial positions of the kangaroos.
  Output the largest number of moves the kangaroos can make.
  ```

* tc

  ```tc
  Input: 2 3 5
  Output: 1  # 2 will jump to 4

  Input: 3 5 9  # A, B, C
  Output: 3     # A will jump to 6, B will jump to 7, A will jump to 8
  ```

## Solution

* js

  ```js
  var [a, b, c] = require('fs').readFileSync('/dev/stdin').toString().split(' ').map(Number);
  console.log(Math.max(c - b - 1, b - a - 1));
  ```

* py

  ```py
  a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
  print(max(c - b - 1, b - a - 1))
  ```
