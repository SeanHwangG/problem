* tc

  ```tc
  Input: 2 1 5  # First day 2, 1 -> Second day 3, 2 -> Third day 4, 3 -> Fourth day 5 (no more slip since you're on top)
  Output: 4

  Input: 5 1 6
  Output: 2

  Input: 100 99 1000000000
  Output: 999999901
  ```

## Solution

* cpp

  ```cpp
  #include <iostream>
  int main() {
    int a, b, v;
    std::cin >> a >> b >> v;
    std::cout << (v - b - 1) / (a - b) + 1;
  }
  ```

* py

  ```py
  import math
  a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
  print(math.ceil((c - a) / (a - b)) + 1)
  ```
