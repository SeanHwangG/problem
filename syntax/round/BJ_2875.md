  N girls and M boys (0 ≤ N, M ≤ 100) are looking for team members, each team must consist of exactly 1 boy and 2 girls.
  Among the students who want to participate in the competition, K (0 ≤ K ≤ M + N) must participate in internship program
  Students who participate in the internship cannot participate in the competition
  Find the maximum number of teams you can make when given N for girls, M for boys, and K for the internship

  ```tc
  Input: 6 3 2
  Output: 2

  Input: 2 1 1
  Output: 0

  Input: 6 10 3
  Output: 3
  ```

## Solution

* cpp

  ```cpp
  #include <bits/stdc++.h>
  using namespace std;
  int main() {
    int a, b, c;
    cin >> a >> b >> c;
    cout << min({a / 2, b, (a + b - c) / 3});
  }
  ```

* py

  ```py
  import math
  a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
  team = min(a // 2, b)
  c = max(0, c - (a - team * 2) - (b - team))
  print(team - math.ceil(c / 3))
  ```
