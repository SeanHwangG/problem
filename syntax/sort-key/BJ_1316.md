# [BJ_1316](https://acmicpc.net/problem/1316)

A group word is for all characters present in a word, only if each character appears in a series
  ccazzzb is a group word because c, a, z, and b are all continuous, and kin are also continuous, k, i, and n
  aabbbccb is not a group word because b is shown separately
Find the number of group words

```txt
Input: 3
happy
new
year

Output: 3
```

## Solution

```py
n=int(input())
ans=n
for i in range(n):
  tmp=input()
  if list(tmp) != sorted(tmp, key = tmp.find): ans-=1
print(ans)
```
