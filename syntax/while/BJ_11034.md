  Three kangaroos are playing on a number line, each occupying a different integer.
  In a single move, one of the outer kangaroos jumps into the space between the other two.
  At no point may two kangaroos occupy the same position.

  Three integers A, B and C (0 < A < B < C < 100), the initial positions of the kangaroos.
  Output the largest number of moves the kangaroos can make.
  ```

* tc

  ```tc
  Input: 2 3 5
  3 5 9

  Output: 1  # 2 will jump to 4
  3          # A will jump to 6, B will jump to 7, A will jump to 8
  ```

## Solution

* cpp

  ```cpp
  #include <bits/stdc++.h>
  using namespace std;
  int main() {
    int n, m, k;
    while (cin >> n >> m >> k) {
      cout << max(k - m, m - n) - 1 << '\n';
    }
  }
  ```

* py

  ```py
  while True:
    try:
      a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
      print(max(b - a, c - b) - 1)
    except:
      break
  ```
