```txt
Input:
In the loop, I read a line of input.

The method std::getline(std::cin, line); reads until a newline, right?

Then I branch according to the last character of the line of input.

When the last character is an exclamation mark, I simply terminate the program.

When the last character is a question mark, I need to print "Quack!" right?

In any other case, I simply print "*Nod*".

Wait, to flush the output stream I need to use std::endl instead of '\n' right?

I quacked the code!

Output:

*Nod*

Quack!

*Nod*

*Nod*

Quack!

*Nod*

Quack!
```

## Solution

* py

```py
while True:
  a = input()
  if a == "I quacked the code!":
    break
  print("*Nod*" if a[-1] == "." else "Quack!")
```
