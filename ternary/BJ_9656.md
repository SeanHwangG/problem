The stone game is played by two people.
There are N stones on the table. SK and CY take turns taking stones, and may take 1 or 3 stones. Whoever takes last stone loses the game.
Write a program to find the winner when two players play the game perfectly. Game starts with full-time employee first.

```txt
Input: 4  # N
Output: SK
```

## Solution

```js
const n = require('fs').readFileSync('/dev/stdin').toString();
console.log((+n % 2) ? 'CY' : 'SK');
```

```py
n = int(input())
print('CY' if n % 2 == 1 else 'SK')
```
